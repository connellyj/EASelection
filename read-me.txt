Files we modified: Breeder.java, Prisoner.java, and TournamentPanel.java
We modified Breeder.java to include fitness proportional selection with sigma scaling if selection = 1 and tournament selection of selection = 2.
We modified Prisoner.java to include a getAllDefect function that generates a population of prisoners that always defect.
We modified TournamentPanel.java to call getAllDefect instead of getRand when generating an initial population, so each simulation starts with a population of always defecting prisoners rather than a random one.
